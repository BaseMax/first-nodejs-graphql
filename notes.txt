==============================================================

create list of endpoints used on the boards with the monday sandbox
one text file for each boards
or just a list on a monday board and the status indicates it's in the code and which files it is connected to

DO NOT FORGET there is a monday VSC Extension that could make it easier
connect to monday
it lists out boards and columns
it lists out id and just about anything else as an autocomplete!

==============================================================
sudo npm install @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/preset-env body-parser concurrently cors express graphql-http graphql  merge-graphql-schemas mongoose nodemon

==============================
if someone gets an error while like "TypeError: graphqlHTTP is not a function"
u can basically do 2 things
1)const { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql');
2)const graphqlHTTP = require('express-graphql').graphqlHTTP;
